3) Implementing a cutting-edge geographical mapping system that employs DBSCAN algorithm-generated timelines to delineate zones of vulnerability. The map visually categorizes regions using a color scheme: red for high vulnerability, green for low, and yellow for moderate, aiding in dynamic risk assessment. Simultaneously, the system identifies and marks prominent garbage accumulation areas, utilizing color codes based on report frequency. This valuable insight equips municipal bodies, such as MCDs, with actionable data for efficient resource allocation and targeted intervention. By merging advanced analytics and geographical visualization, this solution enables proactive decision-making, enhancing overall urban planning and waste management strategies.

4) Our reporting system offers users the flexibility to submit information either anonymously or with identification, ensuring a versatile and inclusive experience. Anonymity empowers individuals to share sensitive information without fear, fostering transparency and increasing the likelihood of reporting critical issues. On the other hand, those comfortable with identification can contribute to a more interactive and personalized resolution process. This dual approach caters to diverse user preferences and the nature of the reported content.
